# UnityProjects
Please use the correct Unity versions for each game (changed in Unityhub for each Project to work straight away).

Otherwise you'll have package update issues and the game might not play.

EG The game titled: rollBallAgainBackUp is made in Unity Version 2019.1.0f2
   The game titled: TerrainAgain        is made in Unity Version 2018.4.2f1
   
   If you use your current Unity Version without changing to these older versions the games will not play.
   
   To get these older versions:
   Make sure you have UnityHub installed. 
   Go to: UnityHub; Installs; Add; Download Archive. 
   Choose the right version (I'm in Dark Reader -- the button is green).
   
   Enjoy
